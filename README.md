# IMPORTANT NOTICES - PLEASE READ !!! 

* **Note:** Some of the usernames in the GitHub got messed up (e.g., LoganZeien vs lzeien are both from Logan or hyran-2bit vs hyran-bit but one appears as a contributor and the other doesn't). Please use the GitHub commit history feature rather than by sorting users, since otherwise you will miss some contributions and be very confused!
* **Note 2:** Srikanth, due to technical issues with him not being added to the GitHub repository despite **multiple** weeks of reaching out to the professor and T/A, does not appear in the commit history. However, he did independently setup up the inventory management system on a separate system implementing key elements such as adding and viewing clothing. The rest of the team then took this code and integrated it into the GitHub to ensure proper working order with our design, existing models, and visual styling. Therefore, rest assured he has made at least equal contributions as the rest of the team, even though he is (at the time of the writing) still not added to the GitHub.
